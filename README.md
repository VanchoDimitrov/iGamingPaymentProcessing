# iGaming Payment Processing and Game Management proposed prototype system architecture
Payment Processing proposed architecture and Game Management by using design patterns in c#

This project is a complex back-end to an abstraction level and console app as a front-end architectural design for Games Management system and Payment processing system. It features a simple User Management system too, and players which to an abstraction level could play games. Games are free or paid, if the game is paid then the player would need to pay for it. There is a queue system as well which determines what game is to be played. From an engineering stand point the project features the SOLID design principals, Enterprise Design Pattern: Domain Model, Identity Field, Foreign key mapping and the Flyweight design pattern too. The system is easy expandable to a distributed system level by the usage of the akka.net framework which also integrates CQRS and Event Sourcing capabilities.
