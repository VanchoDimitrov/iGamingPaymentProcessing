# iGaming Payment Processing and Game Management proposed prototype system architecture
Payment Processing proposed architecture and Game Management by using design patterns in c#

Project is a complex back-end to an abstraction level and console app as a front-end architectural design for Games Management system and Payment processing system. It features a simple User Management system too, and players which to an abstraction level could play games. Games are free or paid, if the game is paid then the player would need to pay for it. From an engineering stand point the project features the SOLID design principals, Enterprise Design Pattern: Domain Model, Identity Field, Foreign key mapping, Order is the parent and the Flyweight design pattern too.
