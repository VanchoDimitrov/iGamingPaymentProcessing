# iGaming Payment Processing and Game Management proposed prototype system architecture
Payment Processing proposed architecture and Game Management by using design patterns in c#

This project is a complex back-end to an abstraction level and console app as a front-end architectural design for Games Management and Payment processing systems. It also features a simple User Management system and players who can play games to an abstraction level. Games are free or paid. If the game is paid, the player would need to pay for it. There is a queue system that determines what game is to be played. From an engineering standpoint, the project features the SOLID design principles, Enterprise Design Pattern: Domain Model, Identity Field, Foreign key mapping and the Flyweight design pattern. The system is easily expandable to a distributed system level using the akka.net framework, which integrates CQRS and Event Sourcing capabilities.
